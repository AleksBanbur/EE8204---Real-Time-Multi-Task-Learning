## Real-Time Joint Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation Using Asymmetric Annotations Implementation

### Summary
This repository provides a python implementation using PyTorch for the following research paper:
Title: Real-Time Joint Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation Using Asymmetric Annotations
Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04766

This page will serve as a guide to explain the paper, but also to walk anyone interested in the paper through the steps needed to implement the network in python.
Currently the implementation us in PyTorch but in the future I would like to convert the implementation to TensorFlow.

### Intro
The focus of this paper is to accomplish semantic segmentation and depth estimation using asymmetrical data sets. An asymmetrical data set is simply a data set that contains labels for one of the tasks but not all of them. In the case of this paper the data sets used are the NYUDv2 indoor and KITTI outdoor images. The data set images may have labelled data referencing the semantic map or the depth information.

In order to accomplish the goal of performing both semantic segmentation and depth estimation the author of the paper V. Nekrasov et al. utilizes the following two techniques:
1. Multi-task Learning - Used to create a network that can accomplish both Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation
2. Knowldge Distillation - Used to estimate missing label information in data sets based on expert pre-trained teacher network

Data Sets Used to Train the weights
A previous network was used with the NYUDv2 and KITTI outdoor data sets to pre-train the weights. These weights were then used in this implementation to show how the network can quickly perform semantic segmentation and depth estimation.

### Network Architecture

The network architecture found in this paper can be broken down into four major parts:
1. Encoder Network
2. Light-Weight Refine Network
3. Chained Residual Pooling blocks
4. Task specific Convolution
    - Segmentation
    - Depth Estimation

A visual summary of the network architecture is provided below directly from the paper.

![Network Architecture](https://github.com/AleksBanbur/EE8204---Real-Time-Multi-Task-Learning/blob/master/Images/Network_architecture.PNG?raw=true)
  
The Encoder network is built from the ResNet architecture and supports ResNet [50, 101, 152]. The ResNet architecutre for the 34 layer network is shown below.
 
![ResNet_34](https://github.com/AleksBanbur/EE8204---Real-Time-Multi-Task-Learning/blob/master/Images/ResNEt_34_Arch.png?raw=true)
 
The ResNet architecture employees residual learning which in short is a skip connection that allows the input to a group of layers to skip and be added back to the output of that layer. This can be visualized as mathematically as F(x) + x where x is the input image and F(x) if the input image after convolution-batch normalization-activation have been perform (possibly also pooling for up/down sampling).

        - Let H16(x) = x_G5_SL3
    
7. Average Pooling (Global Average Pooling)
    - Global Average Pooling is applied to the output of the last convolutional grouping in the ResNet 34. This global average pooling takes the 7 x 7 x 512 tensor of feature maps and averages the 7 x 7 feature map into a 1 x 1 feature map of depth 512. The output of this layer is a feature map of 1 x 1 x 512.

8. Full Connected Layer
    - The Global Average Pooling is the connected to each output neuron. Each feature map in the 1 x 1 x 512 is connected to the output neurons making this a fully connected layer.

The ResNet 34 architecutre shown above can be extended to 50/101/152 layers. This example is just to illustrate the encoder architecutre used in the paper. The different ResNet architecutres can all be used to determine which architecture gives the best results. For each ResNet architecture the decoder architecture which uses the Light Weight RefineNet will need to be updated.

The encoder passes the output directly to the Light Weight RefineNet at the output of the encorder and through chained residual pooling blocks. The Light Weight RefineNet implementation is used as a decoder with an architecture as described in the following paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03272.pdf where modification are made to the original RefineNet to make it more desirable for real time semantic segmentation. A basic idea of the architecture is shown in the picture below:

![Light Weight RefineNet](https://github.com/AleksBanbur/EE8204---Real-Time-Multi-Task-Learning/blob/master/Images/LWRN_General.PNG?raw=true)

The main changes found in this paper to the architecutre of the Light Weight Refine Network is the changing of the Residual Convolution Units (RCU) that connect the output of each encoder feature map to the decoder are now Chained Residual Pooling (CRP) blocks. This means that at the input of each decoder layered grouping the corresponding feature map from the encoder will pass throught the CRP blocks before beginning the process of following the Light Weight Refine Network architecutre of passing through a light weight fusion block, leight weight CRP block, and a leight weight RCU block before all being added together to create an output image the same size as the input image.

![Light Weight RefineNet](https://github.com/AleksBanbur/EE8204---Real-Time-Multi-Task-Learning/blob/master/Images/LW_CRP_RCU_FUSION_Blocks.PNG?raw=true)

Finally, the paper makes use of two task branches at the output of the Light Weight Refine Network. Each branch has the same architecture with a 1x1 depth convolution and a 3x3 convolution. Using Multitask learning each branch is able to perform a signle task such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.
  

### Paper Implementation

How to run the code
In order to get this code to run I recommend copying the entire repository to your local drive. Create a folder and then use the python venv function to create a local copy of the python interpreter.

The dependencies for this project will be listed below. This specific implementation was done in windows 7 ultimate 64 bit. Using a pretrained network for real time semantic segmentation and depth estimation. The pre trained network can be found in the weights folder. It is possible to pre-train a netowkr with specific weights using a different architecture but in this implementation I decicded to follow the original authors methodoolgy to try and get results as close as possibly to the original paper.

Exmaple of projecy directory creation in command line:
```
mkdir my_Project
-m venv my_Project\venv
```
Extract this repositor to within the folder you created but do not place the venv folder. Once the requirements.txt folder is in your selected folder run the following command in command prompt to download the required libraries/frameworks:
```
my_Project\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
